## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js** (v18+)
2. **Ollama** installed on your system (Download at ollama.com)
3. Pull a lightweight model to your machine:
   ```bash
   ollama run llama3.2
   ```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository (or extract the folder).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev

## 💡 How It Works
- **AI Chat Workspace:** Chat with your local AI, ask it business questions, or upload a PDF by clicking the paperclip icon. The PDF is analyzed directly on your device.
- **Agentic Actions:** If you type "Create an invoice for John Doe for 50000", the AI will intelligently call the internal tools and add the invoice to your Finance tab automatically!
- **Data Persistence:** Everything you add (customers, documents, invoices) is securely saved inside your browser's IndexedDB.
